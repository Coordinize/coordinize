## Database Management

Coordinize uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Here's how to work with it:

1. **Database Structure**

   The database schema is defined in the `packages/database/prisma` directory.

2. **Common Database Tasks**

   ```bash
   # Apply migrations
   bun db:migrate

   # View and edit data with Prisma Studio
   bun db:studio
   ```

3. **Database Connection**

   Make sure your database connection string is in:

   - `packages/database/.env`

   For local development:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/coordinize"
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting**

   - **Connection Issues**: Make sure Docker is running
   - **Schema Errors**: Check your schema files for errors
